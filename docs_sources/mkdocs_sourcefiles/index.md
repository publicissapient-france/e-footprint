# Welcome to the e-footprint documentation !

If you are new to e-footprint, start by checking out the [explanation section](explanation_overview.md), then the [tutorial](tutorial.md).

All e-footprint objects, parameters and calculated attributes are listed in the [e-footprint object reference](object_reference.md). 

Moreover, e-footprint has higher-level functions to facilitate the construction of objects from fewer parameters. You can check them out in the [e-footprint builders reference](builders.md). 

The source code is available in the [e-footprint github repository](https://github.com/Boavizta/e-footprint) and a [graphical interface](https://e-footprint-interface.nw.r.appspot.com/) is under construction to facilitate the use of the model (in beta for now, your feedback is appreciated). 

This project has been initiated by [Vincent Villet](mailto:vincent.villet@publicissapient.com) for <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient</a> and is now part of the <a href="https://www.boavizta.org/en" target="_blank">green IT association Boavizta</a>’s ecosystem of open source tools.
